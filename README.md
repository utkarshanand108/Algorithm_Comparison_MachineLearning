**Algorithm Comparison in Machine Learning — DS PGC Course 6 Assignment 1**

---

## 📘 Assignment Overview
This assignment explores **four core Machine Learning algorithms** — Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).  
It explains how each algorithm works, their strengths and limitations, and compares their suitability across various real-world dataset scenarios.

## 🧩 Tasks Summary
**Part 1 — Algorithm Overviews**
- Logistic Regression — interpretable, probabilistic classifier assuming linear separability.  
- K-Nearest Neighbors — instance-based learner that predicts based on local similarity.  
- Decision Tree — rule-based, interpretable model handling non-linear patterns.  
- Support Vector Machine — margin-maximizing classifier, powerful in high-dimensional data.

**Part 2 — Application Scenarios**
1. **High-Dimensional Data (Text/Gene)** → *SVM (Linear Kernel)*  
2. **Imbalanced Dataset (Fraud/Rare Disease)** → *Logistic Regression (Class Weights)*  
3. **Small Dataset with Many Features** → *SVM (Regularized Linear Kernel)*  
4. **Non-Linear Data Separation (Spirals/Circles)** → *SVM (RBF Kernel)*  
5. **Noisy Data / Many Irrelevant Features** → *Logistic Regression (L1 Regularization)*

## 🧭 Key Learnings
- Logistic Regression and SVM perform best on structured, high-dimensional, or imbalanced data.  
- KNN is effective for simple, low-dimensional, balanced datasets but not scalable.  
- Decision Trees excel in interpretability but risk overfitting without pruning.  
- SVM’s kernel flexibility handles non-linear separations, outperforming others in complex spaces.
